# To Do List!
---
## A simple JavaScript Application Exercise.

---

Welcome to my first independent project! To Do List is a simple application
using my knowledge of JavaScript Arrays.   

##### Features:

At list time the Application will be based
solely around prompt(), alert(), and console.log(). Updated changes around DOM Manipulation
will come in the next updates

+ When you refresh the page a prompt will ask "What would you like to do?"
+ Type "new" to add a new task
+ Type "list" to see all tasks in your list
+ Type "quit" to exit the application

##### Updates:

+ Initial Repository created: 5/23/2018
